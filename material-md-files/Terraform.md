<summary>What is the workflow for deploying new infrastructure with Terraform?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. terraform plan to import the current infrastructure to the state file, make code changes, and terraform apply to update the infrastructure.`
- `B. Write a Terraform configuration, run terraform show to view proposed changes, and terraform apply to create new infrastructure.`
- `C. terraform import to import the current infrastructure to the state file, make code changes, and terraform apply to update the infrastructure.`
- `D. Write a Terraform configuration, run terraform init, run terraform plan to view planned infrastructure changes, and terraform apply to create new infrastructure.`

**Correct Answer:** `D. Write a Terraform configuration, run terraform init, run terraform plan to view planned infrastructure changes, and terraform apply to create new infrastructure.`

**Explanation**:  
To deploy new infrastructure using Terraform, follow these steps:
1. Write the Terraform configuration specifying the desired infrastructure resources.
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the configuration and download necessary provider plugins.
3. Run `terraform plan` to see the execution plan and ensure the desired changes match your expectation.
4. Run `terraform apply` to provision the specified resources and create the new infrastructure.

<details>
<summary>A provider configuration block is required in every Terraform configuration.</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. True`
- `B. False`

**Correct Answer:** `A. True`

**Explanation**:  
In Terraform, a provider configuration block is essential as it specifies which provider (e.g., AWS, Azure) Terraform should use to interact with the underlying infrastructure. Without a provider configuration block, Terraform cannot manage resources associated with a specific provider.

</b></details>


<details>
<summary>You run a local-exec provisioner in a null resource called null_resource.run_script and realize that you need to rerun the script. Which of the following commands would you use first?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. terraform taint null_resource.run_script`
- `B. terraform apply -target=null_resource.run_script`
- `C. terraform validate null_resource.run_script`
- `D. terraform plan -target=null_resource.run_script`

**Correct Answer:** `B. terraform apply -target=null_resource.run_script`

**Explanation**:  
To rerun a specific resource in Terraform, the `-target` flag is used to isolate the execution onto that resource. Running `terraform apply -target=null_resource.run_script` ensures that the null resource (`run_script`) is executed again without impacting other resources defined in the configuration.

</b></details>


<details>
<summary>Which provisioner invokes a process on the resource created by Terraform?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. remote-exec`
- `B. null-exec`
- `C. local-exec`
- `D. file`

**Correct Answer:** `A. remote-exec`

**Explanation**:  
The `remote-exec` provisioner allows Terraform to execute scripts or commands on a remote resource, such as a newly created virtual machine, after it has been provisioned. This is useful for performing post-provisioning tasks like software installation or configuration.

**Reference**:  
[Terraform Remote-Exec Provisioner Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/provisioners/remote-exec.html)

</b></details>


<details>

**Options:**
- `A. Providers can be written by individuals`
- `B. Providers can be maintained by a community of users`
- `C. Some providers are maintained by HashiCorp`
- `D. Major cloud vendors and non-cloud vendors can write, maintain, or collaborate on Terraform providers`
- `E. None of the above`

**Correct Answer:** `E. None of the above`

**Explanation**:  
All the statements about Terraform providers are true:
- Providers can indeed be written by individuals.
- Providers can also be maintained by a community of users.
- Some providers are officially maintained by HashiCorp to ensure reliability and consistency.
- Major cloud vendors, as well as non-cloud vendors, actively contribute to developing and maintaining Terraform providers, enabling better integration and usability.

<details>
<summary>What command does Terraform require the first time you run it within a configuration directory?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. terraform import`
- `B. terraform init`
- `C. terraform plan`
- `D. terraform workspace`

**Correct Answer:** `B. terraform init`

**Explanation**:  
The `terraform init` command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This command prepares the directory for use by downloading the required provider plugins and setting up the Terraform environment.

**Reference**:  
[Terraform Init Command Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/init.html)
</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You have deployed a new web app with a public IP address on a cloud provider. However, you did not create any outputs for your code. What is the best method to quickly find the IP address of the resource you deployed?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. Run terraform output ip_address to view the result`
- `B. In a new folder, use the terraform_remote_state data source to load in the state file, then write an output for each resource that you find in the state file`
- `C. Run terraform state list to find the name of the resource, then terraform state show to find the attributes including public IP address`
- `D. Run terraform destroy then terraform apply and look for the IP address in stdout`

**Correct Answer:** `C. Run terraform state list to find the name of the resource, then terraform state show to find the attributes including public IP address`

**Explanation**:  
Using `terraform state list` allows you to identify all resources managed in the current state file. Once you find the name of the desired resource, you can run `terraform state show` to inspect its attributes, including the public IP address. This method avoids unnecessary operations like destroying or reapplying resources and enables quick discovery of resource details.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which of the following is not a key principle of infrastructure as code?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. Versioned infrastructure`
- `B. Golden images`
- `C. Idempotence`
- `D. Self-describing infrastructure`

**Correct Answer:** `B. Golden images`

**Explanation**:  
Golden images are preconfigured disk images used to deploy environments and are not a core principle of infrastructure as code (IaC). The key principles of IaC include:
- **Versioned infrastructure:** Treating infrastructure as version-controlled code.
- **Idempotence:** Ensuring deployments produce the same results no matter how many times they are applied.
- **Self-describing infrastructure:** Clearly defining the desired state within configuration files.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Terraform variables and outputs that set the "description" argument will store that description in the state file.</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. True`
- `B. False`

**Correct Answer:** `B. False`

**Explanation**:  
The "description" argument set in Terraform variables or outputs is purely informational and is not stored in the state file. Terraform state files only contain essential resource attributes and metadata required for infrastructure management, not descriptive information.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What is the provider for this fictitious resource?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. vpc`
- `B. main`
- `C. aws`
- `D. test`

**Correct Answer:** `C. aws`

**Explanation**:  
In Terraform, the provider is specified at the beginning of a resource type. For example, `aws_vpc` denotes that the resource is managed by the AWS provider. Here, `aws` is the provider, `vpc` is the resource type, and `main` is the resource name.

**Reference**:  
[AWS Resource Types Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-types.html)

</b></details>


<details>
<summary>If you manually destroy infrastructure, what is the best practice reflecting this change in Terraform?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. Run terraform refresh`
- `B. It will happen automatically`
- `C. Manually update the state file`
- `D. Run terraform import`

**Correct Answer:** `A. Run terraform refresh`

**Explanation**:  
When you manually destroy infrastructure outside of Terraform, the Terraform state file will not be automatically updated. Running `terraform refresh` allows Terraform to sync the state file with the actual resources by querying the real-world infrastructure and ensuring the state file reflects the current reality.

</b></details>


<details>
<summary>What is not processed when running a terraform refresh?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. State file`
- `B. Configuration file`
- `C. Credentials`
- `D. Cloud provider`

**Correct Answer:** `B. Configuration file`

**Explanation**:  
When running `terraform refresh`, Terraform updates the state file to match the actual infrastructure by querying the cloud provider or other resource APIs. The configuration file is not processed during this operation, as the refresh only deals with the state file and actual infrastructure resources.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>What information does the public Terraform Module Registry automatically expose about published modules?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. Required input variables`
- `B. Optional input variables and default values`
- `C. Outputs`
- `D. All of the above`
- `E. None of the above`

**Correct Answer:** `D. All of the above`

**Explanation**:  
The public Terraform Module Registry automatically exposes the following information about published modules:
- **Required input variables**: Variables that must be defined for the module to function.
- **Optional input variables and default values**: Variables with default values that can be overridden.
- **Outputs**: Values generated by the module, which can be used in other parts of the Terraform configuration.

These details help users understand how to use and integrate the module effectively.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>If a module uses a local value, you can expose that value with a terraform output.</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. True`
- `B. False`

**Correct Answer:** `A. True`

**Explanation**:  
Output values in Terraform serve as a way to expose data from a module to be used in other parts of the configuration or by the user. If a module uses a local value, it can be referenced in an output block within that module to expose it for consumption elsewhere.

**References**:  
- [Terraform Locals Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/locals.html)  
- [Terraform Outputs Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/values/outputs.html)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You should store secret data in the same version control repository as your Terraform configuration.</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. True`
- `B. False`

**Correct Answer:** `B. False`

**Explanation**:  
Storing secrets (e.g., credentials, API keys) in the same version control repository as your Terraform configuration is a bad practice as it exposes sensitive information to potential security risks. Instead, use secret management mechanisms like environment variables, Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Terraform's own `sensitive` attribute to protect sensitive data.

**Reference**:  
[A Comprehensive Guide to Managing Secrets in Terraform Code](https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-managing-secrets-in-your-terraform-code-1d6586955ace1)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which of the following is not a valid string function in Terraform?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. split`
- `B. join`
- `C. slice`
- `D. chomp`

**Correct Answer:** `C. slice`

**Explanation**:  
In Terraform, `split`, `join`, and `chomp` are valid string functions:
- **split**: Splits a string into a list based on a delimiter.
- **join**: Joins elements of a list into a single string with a delimiter.
- **chomp**: Removes trailing newline characters from a string.

The `slice` function, however, is not a valid Terraform string function, as slicing operations are not directly supported in Terraform. For more advanced text manipulation, you'd need to use workarounds or external tools.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You have provisioned some virtual machines (VMs) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the gcloud command-line tool. However, you are standardizing with Terraform and want to manage these VMs using Terraform instead. What are the two things you must do to achieve this? (Choose two.)</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. Provision new VMs using Terraform with the same VM names`
- `B. Use the terraform import command for the existing VMs`
- `C. Write Terraform configuration for the existing VMs`
- `D. Run the terraform import-gcp command`

**Correct Answer:** `B. Use the terraform import command for the existing VMs`  
`C. Write Terraform configuration for the existing VMs`

**Explanation**:  
To bring existing infrastructure under Terraform's management without recreating it:
1. Use the `terraform import` command to manually import the existing resources (e.g., VMs) into Terraform's state file.
2. Write Terraform configuration that mirrors the current state of the resources. The configuration must define the same attributes and parameters for successful management after import.

Terraform does not automatically generate configuration files, so manual configuration writing is necessary.

<details>
<summary>You are an engineer tasked with evaluating multiple outages that occurred during peak traffic times. You discover that the team manually deploys and configures new compute instances. This led to inconsistent configurations between each compute instance. How would you solve this using infrastructure as code?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. Implement a ticketing workflow that makes engineers submit a ticket before manually provisioning and configuring a resource`
- `B. Implement a checklist that engineers can follow when configuring compute instances`
- `C. Replace the compute instance type with a larger version to reduce the number of required deployments`
- `D. Build a provisioning pipeline that deploys infrastructure configurations committed to your version control system, following code reviews`

**Correct Answer:** `D. Build a provisioning pipeline that deploys infrastructure configurations committed to your version control system, following code reviews`

**Explanation**:  
Using infrastructure as code (IaC) encourages consistent deployment by:
- Storing configuration in version control systems for better collaboration and traceability.
- Automating provisioning pipelines to ensure all resources are deployed in a standardized and repeatable manner.
- Enabling code reviews to ensure all infrastructure changes are reviewed and approved before deployment.

This approach minimizes human error and ensures reliability during deployments.

<details>
<summary>terraform init initializes a sample main.tf file in the current directory.</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. True`
- `B. False`

**Correct Answer:** `B. False`

**Explanation**:  
The `terraform init` command initializes a working directory with all the necessary files for Terraform to manage infrastructure. It downloads provider plugins, sets up the backend, and prepares the directory for running Terraform commands. However, it does **not** create a `main.tf` file or any configuration files. Users must write their own `.tf` configuration files manually or copy them into the directory.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which two steps are required to provision new infrastructure in the Terraform workflow? (Choose two.)</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. Destroy`
- `B. Apply`
- `C. Import`
- `D. Init`
- `E. Validate`

**Correct Answer:** `B. Apply`  
`D. Init`

**Explanation**:  
To provision new infrastructure using Terraform, the following steps are required:  
1. **Init (`terraform init`)**: Initializes the working directory by downloading necessary provider plugins and preparing the backend for state management.  
2. **Apply (`terraform apply`)**: Executes the Terraform configuration to create or modify infrastructure resources.  

Other steps like `terraform validate` or `terraform import` are not mandatory for provisioning new infrastructure, while `terraform destroy` is used for removing resources.

<details>
<summary>Why would you use the terraform taint command?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. When you want to force Terraform to destroy a resource on the next apply`
- `B. When you want to force Terraform to destroy and recreate a resource on the next apply`
- `C. When you want Terraform to ignore a resource on the next apply`
- `D. When you want Terraform to destroy all the infrastructure in your workspace`

**Correct Answer:** `B. When you want to force Terraform to destroy and recreate a resource on the next apply`

**Explanation**:  
The `terraform taint` command is used to manually mark a resource as tainted. A tainted resource will be destroyed and recreated on the next `terraform apply`. This is useful in cases where a resource needs to be replaced due to corruption, misconfiguration, or a manual override.

**Reference**:  
[Terraform Taint Command Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/taint.html)

<details>
<summary>Terraform requires the Go runtime as a prerequisite for installation.</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. True`
- `B. False`

**Correct Answer:** `A. True`

**Explanation**:  
Terraform is written in the Go programming language, and the Go runtime is required for its development and installation processes. However, for simply using Terraform as an end-user, the Go runtime is not required, as Terraform distributions include precompiled binaries.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>When should you use the force-unlock command?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. You see a status message that you cannot acquire the lock`
- `B. You have a high priority change`
- `C. Automatic unlocking failed`
- `D. apply failed due to a state lock`

**Correct Answer:** `C. Automatic unlocking failed`

**Explanation**:  
The `terraform force-unlock` command is used to manually unlock a Terraform state that is locked. This is typically required when automatic unlocking fails due to unexpected scenarios, such as a crash or a stale lock held by a previous operation. Use this command cautiously to avoid corrupting the state file.

**Reference**:  
[Terraform Force Unlock Command Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/force-unlock.html)

<details>
<summary>Terraform can import modules from a number of sources – which of the following is not a valid source?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. FTP server`
- `B. GitHub repository`
- `C. Local path`
- `D. Terraform Module Registry`

**Correct Answer:** `A. FTP server`

**Explanation**:  
Terraform supports importing modules from various sources, including:
- **GitHub repository:** Sources hosted on Git or other version control systems.
- **Local path:** Local files and directories.
- **Terraform Module Registry:** A centralized location for reusable Terraform modules.

However, Terraform does not support pulling modules from an **FTP server**, making it an invalid source.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>Which of the following is available only in Terraform Enterprise or Cloud workspaces and not in Terraform CLI?</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. Secure variable storage`
- `B. Support for multiple cloud providers`
- `C. Dry runs with terraform plan`
- `D. Using the workspace as a data source`

**Correct Answer:** `A. Secure variable storage`

**Explanation**:  
Secure storage of sensitive variables is a feature exclusive to Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise. This enables users to store and manage variables securely using encryption. 

Other features, such as support for multiple cloud providers, `terraform plan` for dry runs, and workspaces as a data source, are available in the Terraform CLI and are not limited to Terraform Cloud or Enterprise.

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>terraform validate validates the syntax of Terraform files.</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. True`
- `B. False`

**Correct Answer:** `A. True`

**Explanation**:  
The `terraform validate` command is used to validate the syntax and arguments of Terraform configuration files. It checks whether the configuration is syntactically valid and internally consistent but does not interact with any APIs or create any resources.

**Reference**:  
[Terraform Validate Command Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/code/index.html)

</b></details>

<details>
<summary>You have used Terraform to create an ephemeral development environment in the cloud and are now ready to destroy all the infrastructure described by your Terraform configuration. To be safe, you would like to first see all the infrastructure that will be deleted by Terraform. Which command should you use to show all of the resources that will be deleted? (Choose two.)</summary><br><b>

**Options:**
- `A. Run terraform plan -destroy.`
- `B. This is not possible. You can only show resources that will be created.`
- `C. Run terraform state rm *.`
- `D. Run terraform destroy and it will first output all the resources that will be deleted before prompting for approval.`

**Correct Answer:** `A. Run terraform plan -destroy.`  
`D. Run terraform destroy and it will first output all the resources that will be deleted before prompting for approval.`

**Explanation**:  
- **`terraform plan -destroy`**: This command creates and displays an execution plan for destroying resources. It allows you to review the resources that will be deleted without actually destroying them.
- **`terraform destroy`**: This command prompts for confirmation and outputs all the resources that will be destroyed before performing the action, allowing you to review the list of resources.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **B**: It is possible to preview deletions with the correct commands.
- **C**: `terraform state rm` is used to remove resources from the state file without affecting the actual infrastructure, not to preview deletions.

**Reference**:  
[Terraform State RM Command Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/state/rm.html)

<details>
<summary>Which of the following is the correct way to pass the value in the variable `num_servers` into a module with the input `servers`?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. servers = num_servers`
- `B. servers = variable.num_servers`
- `C. servers = var(num_servers)`
- `D. servers = var.num_servers`

**Correct Answer:** `D. servers = var.num_servers`

**Explanation**:  
- **`servers = var.num_servers`**: In Terraform, variables are referenced using the `var.` prefix, followed by the variable name (`num_servers`). This is the correct syntax for passing a variable value to module inputs or other configuration blocks.
  
**Incorrect Options:**  
- **A**: Directly referencing `num_servers` without the `var.` prefix is invalid in Terraform syntax.  
- **B**: Using `variable.num_servers` is incorrect because `variable` is not the correct usage in this context for variables in Terraform.  
- **C**: Syntax like `var(num_servers)` is not recognized in Terraform; parentheses are not used for variable referencing.

**Reference**:  
[Terraform Variables Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

<details>
<summary>A Terraform provisioner must be nested inside a resource configuration block.</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. True`
- `B. False`

**Correct Answer:** `A. True`

**Explanation**:  
Most provisioners in Terraform require access to the remote resource (typically using SSH or WinRM protocols) and must be defined within a resource block. Provisioners enable you to execute scripts or perform configuration tasks on the resources after they are created. Additionally, the resource block often includes a nested connection block to specify details about how Terraform communicates with the resource.

**Reference**:  
[Terraform Provisioners Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/resources/provisioners/connection.html)

<details>
<summary>Terraform can run on Windows or Linux, but it requires a Server version of the Windows operating system.</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. True`
- `B. False`

**Correct Answer:** `B. False`

**Explanation**:  
Terraform does not require a Server version of the Windows operating system to run. It is supported on both Windows (including non-server versions), Linux, and macOS. Terraform is a lightweight binary and works across multiple operating systems without requiring specialized versions.

<summary>What does the default "local" Terraform backend store?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. tfplan files`
- `B. Terraform binary`
- `C. Provider plugins`
- `D. State file`

**Correct Answer:** `D. State file`

**Explanation**:  
The default "local" backend in Terraform is responsible for storing the state file on the local filesystem. The state file tracks the current state of the infrastructure managed by Terraform and is critical for operations like detecting changes and applying updates. Additionally, the local backend locks the state during updates using system APIs to prevent concurrent modifications.

**Reference**:  
[Terraform Local Backend Documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/local.html)

<details>
<summary>You have multiple team members collaborating on infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform, and want to apply formatting standards for readability. How can you format Terraform HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) code according to standard Terraform style convention?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. Run the terraform fmt command during the code linting phase of your CI/CD process`
- `B. Designate one person in each team to review and format everyone's code`
- `C. Manually apply two spaces indentation and align equal sign "=" characters in every Terraform file (*.tf)`
- `D. Write a shell script to transform Terraform files using tools such as AWK, Python, and sed`

**Correct Answer:** `A. Run the terraform fmt command during the code linting phase of your CI/CD process`

**Explanation**:  
The `terraform fmt` command automatically formats Terraform code (*.tf files) to follow the standard style convention defined by Terraform. It ensures uniform indentation and alignment, making the code consistent and readable for all team members. Running this command regularly as part of the CI/CD process helps enforce code formatting across the team without requiring manual intervention.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **B**: Designating someone to manually review and format code is time-consuming and error-prone.
- **C**: Manually formatting is inefficient and prone to inconsistencies.
- **D**: Writing custom scripts is unnecessary since Terraform provides the `fmt` command for this purpose.

**Reference**:  
[Terraform Formatting Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/fmt)

<details>
<summary>What value does the Terraform Cloud/Terraform Enterprise private module registry provide over the public Terraform Module Registry?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. The ability to share modules with public Terraform users and members of Terraform Enterprise Organizations`
- `B. The ability to tag modules by version or release`
- `C. The ability to restrict modules to members of Terraform Cloud or Enterprise organizations`
- `D. The ability to share modules publicly with any user of Terraform`

**Correct Answer:** `C. The ability to restrict modules to members of Terraform Cloud or Enterprise organizations`

**Explanation**:  
The private module registry in Terraform Cloud or Enterprise provides the capability to securely host and manage private modules. Unlike the public module registry, the private module registry allows you to restrict access to modules so that only authenticated members of specific Terraform Cloud or Enterprise organizations can fetch and use them. This is particularly useful for sensitive or proprietary infrastructure code.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **A**: Modules in the private registry are not shared publicly or with public Terraform users.
- **B**: Module versioning is supported in both public and private registries, but it is not unique to the private registry.
- **D**: The private module registry does not allow public sharing; it is specifically used for organizational access control.

<details>
<summary>Which task does terraform init <u>not</u> perform?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. Sources all providers present in the configuration and ensures they are downloaded and available locally`
- `B. Connects to the backend`
- `C. Sources any modules and copies the configuration locally`
- `D. Validates all required variables are present`

**Correct Answer:** `D. Validates all required variables are present`

**Explanation**:  
The `terraform init` command is used to initialize a working directory containing a Terraform configuration. It handles tasks such as downloading providers, setting up the backend, and sourcing any modules used in the configuration. However, it does not validate the presence of required variables during initialization. Variable validation occurs at the `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` stages.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **A**: `terraform init` sources and downloads providers defined in the configuration.
- **B**: It connects to the backend to allow for remote state storage if a backend is configured.
- **C**: It fetches and copies any external modules defined in the configuration.

<summary>You have declared a variable called `var.list` which is a list of objects that all have an attribute `id`. Which options will produce a list of the IDs? (Choose two.)</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. { for o in var.list : o => o.id }`
- `B. var.list[*].id`
- `C. [ var.list[*].id ]`
- `D. [ for o in var.list : o.id ]`

**Correct Answers:** `B. var.list[*].id` and `D. [ for o in var.list : o.id ]`

**Explanation**:  
- **`B. var.list[*].id`**: This uses Terraform's splat expression syntax to create a list of the `id` attributes from all objects in the `var.list`. The `[*].id` extracts the `id` for each element in the list.
  
- **`D. [ for o in var.list : o.id ]`**: This uses Terraform's for expressions to loop over each object in `var.list` and extract the `id` attribute, returning a new list of the `id` values.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **A**: This syntax is incorrect. The use of `{}` creates a map, not a list, and `=>` is not valid syntax in Terraform for constructing a map.
- **C**: This syntax wraps the splat expression in additional brackets, producing a list containing a single element, which is itself another list. It does not flatten into a list of `id` values.

<summary>Which argument(s) is (are) required when declaring a Terraform variable?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. type`
- `B. default`
- `C. description`
- `D. All of the above`
- `E. None of the above`

**Correct Answer:** `E. None of the above`

**Explanation**:  
When declaring a Terraform variable, none of the arguments (`type`, `default`, `description`) are strictly required. Terraform can infer the type of a variable based on its value or usage, and a default value or description is optional. If a variable does not have a default value, Terraform treats it as mandatory and expects the user to provide a value either via input or a `.tfvars` file.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **A. type**: While defining the type explicitly is helpful for clarity, it is not mandatory since Terraform can infer the type.
- **B. default**: Providing a default value is optional. Without a default, the variable must be supplied as input.
- **C. description**: The description is purely informative and optional.
- **D. All of the above**: None of these are mandatory.

<summary>When using a module block to reference a module stored on the public Terraform Module Registry, how do you specify version 1.0.0?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. Modules stored on the public Terraform Module Registry do not support versioning`
- `B. Append ?ref=v1.0.0 argument to the source path`
- `C. Add version = "1.0.0" attribute to module block`
- `D. Nothing – modules stored on the public Terraform Module Registry always default to version 1.0.0`

**Correct Answer:** `C. Add version = "1.0.0" attribute to module block`

**Explanation**:  
When referencing modules stored on the public Terraform Module Registry (e.g., `hashicorp/consul/aws`), you specify the desired module version using the `version` argument in the module block. This ensures Terraform fetches and uses the correct version of the module, maintaining version control and consistency across deployments.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **A.** Modules in the public registry support versioning via the `version` attribute.
- **B.** While appending `?ref=v1.0.0` is commonly used with Git source URLs, it is not applicable for modules from the public Terraform Module Registry.
- **D.** Modules do not default to version 1.0.0 unless explicitly specified.

<summary>What features does the hosted service Terraform Cloud provide? (Choose two)</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. Automated infrastructure deployment visualization`
- `B. Automatic backups`
- `C. Remote state storage`
- `D. A web-based user interface (UI)`

**Correct Answers:** `C. Remote state storage` and `D. A web-based user interface (UI)`

**Explanation**:  
Terraform Cloud offers the following key features:  
- **Remote state storage (C):** Terraform Cloud provides centralized state storage, making it easier to collaborate in a team environment by ensuring that state is securely stored and shared across team members.
- **Web-based user interface (D):** Terraform Cloud includes a web UI for managing workspaces, user access, state versions, and other administrative controls.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **A.** Terraform Cloud does not provide automated infrastructure deployment visualization as a built-in feature.
- **B.** While Terraform manages state safely, it does not provide general-purpose automatic backup functionality as a specific feature.

<summary>Where does the Terraform local backend store its state?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. In the /tmp directory`
- `B. In the terraform file`
- `C. In the terraform.tfstate file`
- `D. In the user's terraform.state file`

**Correct Answer:** `C. In the terraform.tfstate file`

**Explanation**:  
The local backend stores the Terraform state file in a file named `terraform.tfstate` on the local filesystem. This file represents the current state of the infrastructure managed by Terraform. The state file is crucial for tracking resources, as it allows Terraform to know which resources already exist and whether changes need to be applied during future runs.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **A.** The `/tmp` directory is not used for state storage by default in Terraform.  
- **B.** Terraform configurations are written in `.tf` files, but the state is not stored in these files.  
- **D.** The state file is named `terraform.tfstate`, not `terraform.state`.

<summary>Which option can not be used to keep secrets out of Terraform configuration files?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. A Terraform provider`
- `B. Environment variables`
- `C. A -var flag`
- `D. secure string`

**Correct Answer:** `D. secure string`

**Explanation**:  
Terraform does not natively support a "secure string" type as a method to securely manage sensitive information directly in configuration files. Instead, secrets should be managed via other mechanisms, such as:  
- **Using environment variables (B):** You can set sensitive data like credentials in environment variables and use `TF_VAR_` prefixes to reference them in configurations.  
- **Using the `-var` flag (C):** You can pass sensitive values at runtime via the `-var` flag when running commands like `terraform plan` or `terraform apply`.  
- **Through a Terraform provider (A):** Some providers enable integration with secret management systems (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).

**Incorrect Option:**
- **D. secure string:** This is not a Terraform feature or supported mechanism to secure secrets.

<summary>What is one disadvantage of using dynamic blocks in Terraform?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. They cannot be used to loop through a list of values`
- `B. Dynamic blocks can construct repeatable nested blocks`
- `C. They make configuration harder to read and understand`
- `D. Terraform will run more slowly`

**Correct Answer:** `C. They make configuration harder to read and understand`

**Explanation**:  
Dynamic blocks are a powerful feature in Terraform that allow you to generate nested blocks programmatically, typically by looping through a list of values. However, their main disadvantage is that they can reduce the readability and clarity of the configuration, especially for users unfamiliar with the `dynamic` syntax. Clear and readable configurations are generally preferred for collaboration and maintainability.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **A.** Dynamic blocks can absolutely be used to loop through a list of values, which is one of their primary use cases.  
- **B.** This statement is true, but it is not a disadvantage; it's a core feature of dynamic blocks.  
- **D.** Using dynamic blocks does not have a significant impact on Terraform's runtime performance.

<summary>Only the user that generated a plan may apply it.</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. True`
- `B. False`

**Correct Answer:** `B. False`

**Explanation**:  
Terraform does not require the same user who generated a plan to apply it. Terraform separates the `plan` and `apply` steps, but the saved plan file (`terraform plan -out=<file>`) can be used by any user with appropriate access to apply the changes. This flexibility allows teams to collaborate effectively, enabling one user to generate the plan and another user to apply it.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **A. True:** This is incorrect; there is no restriction that limits the application of a saved plan file to the same user who generated it.

<summary>What value should you enter for the `ami` argument in the AWS instance resource to use the AWS AMI data source?</summary>

**Terraform Configuration:**
```hcl
data "aws_ami" "ubuntu" {
}
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami             = _______________
  instance_type   = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "HelloWorld"
  }
}
```

**Options:**

- A. aws_ami.ubuntu
- B. data.aws_ami.ubuntu
- C. data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
- D. aws_ami.ubuntu.id

**Correct Answer:** C. data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id

Explanation:
When referencing a data source in Terraform, you need to use the data.<type>.<name> syntax. To retrieve the id of the AMI from the aws_ami data source, the correct property is id. Thus, the correct reference for the ami attribute is data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id.

<summary>You need to specify a dependency manually. What resource meta-parameter can you use to make sure Terraform respects the dependency?</summary>

**Correct Answer:** `depends_on`

**Explanation**:  
The `depends_on` meta-parameter allows you to explicitly specify a dependency between resources in Terraform. This ensures that Terraform respects the order of operations by waiting for the dependent resource to finish its creation, update, or destruction before proceeding. It is useful in scenarios where Terraform might not automatically infer dependencies.

**Example Usage:**
```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  # Resource configuration
}

resource "aws_eip" "example" {
  depends_on = [aws_instance.example]
  # Ensures the EIP is associated only after the instance is created
}
```

<summary>You have created a new virtual machine (VM) using Terraform and want to delete it. What should you do to delete the newly-created VM with Terraform?</summary>

**Options:**
- `A. The Terraform state file contains all 16 VMs in the team account. Execute terraform destroy and select the newly-created VM.`
- `B. The Terraform state file only contains the one new VM. Execute terraform destroy.`
- `C. Delete the Terraform state file and execute terraform apply.`
- `D. Delete the VM using the cloud provider console and terraform apply to apply the changes to the Terraform state file.`

**Correct Answer:** `B. The Terraform state file only contains the one new VM. Execute terraform destroy.`

**Explanation**:  
Terraform manages resources defined in your configuration using the state file. Since the state file for this configuration only tracks the newly-created VM, you can run `terraform destroy`. This command will use the state file to identify and delete the resources it manages—in this case, the one VM created by Terraform. There is no need to delete resources manually or interfere with the state file.

**Incorrect Options:**
- **A:** The Terraform state file does not include unmanaged resources (e.g., the other 15 VMs created outside of Terraform), so destroying all resources is unnecessary in this context.  
- **C:** Deleting the state file would remove Terraform's ability to manage existing resources, such as the VM. This is not recommended.  
- **D:** Using the cloud provider console to delete resources manually may leave the Terraform state file out of sync with the actual infrastructure unless properly reconciled, which requires additional steps.

<summary>What is the name assigned by Terraform to reference this resource?</summary>

**Terraform Configuration:**
```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "dev" {
  name     = "test"
  location = "westus"
}
```

**Options:**

- A. dev
- B. azurerm_resource_group
- C. azurerm
- D. test

**Correct Answer:** A. dev

Explanation:
In Terraform, the name assigned to reference a resource is defined in the resource block after the resource type. In this case:

azurerm_resource_group is the resource type (Azure resource group).
dev is the local name (or resource name) that you use to reference this specific resource in the configuration.
To reference this resource elsewhere, you would use azurerm_resource_group.dev.

Incorrect Options:

- B. azurerm_resource_group: This is the type of the resource, not the specific name assigned to it.
- C. azurerm: This is part of the provider name but not relevant to the specific resource's reference name.
- D. test: This is the value of the name attribute, not the name for referencing the resource in the configuration.
