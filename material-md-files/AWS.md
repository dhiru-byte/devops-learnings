<summary> How many Subnets can you have per VPC?.</code></summary><br><b>

`200 Subnets per VPC`
</b></details>

<details>
<summary> Relation between the Availability Zone and Region?.</code></summary><br><b>

Each Region is a separate geographic area. 

Availability Zones are multiple, isolated locations within each Region.

<summary> What does AMI include?.</code></summary><br><b>

An AMI includes the following things:

* A template for the root volume for the instance.

* Launch permissions to decide which AWS accounts can avail the AMI to launch instances.

* A block device mapping that determines the volumes to attach to the instance when it is launched.

<summary> What does serverless mean to you ?.</code></summary><br><b>

Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers.

There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development. A cloud provider handles the routine work of provisioning, maintaining, and scaling the server infrastructure. Developers can simply package their code in containers for deployment.

Once deployed, serverless apps respond to demand and automatically scale up and down as needed. Serverless offerings from public cloud providers are usually metered on-demand through an event-driven execution model. As a result, when a serverless function is sitting idle, it doesn’t cost anything.

<summary> Different storage classes in AWS ?.</code></summary><br><b>

* `Amazon S3 Standard (S3 Standard)`
* `Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering)`
* `Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)`
* `Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)`
* `Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier)`
* `Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive)`
* `S3 Outposts storage class` : object storage to your on-premises AWS Outposts environment. Using the S3 APIs and features available in AWS Regions today, S3 on Outposts makes it easy to store and retrieve data on your Outpost, as well as secure the data, control access, tag, and report on it. S3 on Outposts provides a single Amazon S3 storage class, named S3 Outposts, which uses the S3 APIs, and is designed to durably and redundantly store data across multiple devices and servers on your Outposts.

<summary>  Diff types of EC2 instances ?..</code></summary><br><b>

* `General Purpose`: The most popular; used for web servers, development environments, etc.
* `Compute Optimized`: Good for compute-intensive applications such as some scientific modeling or high-performance web servers.
* `Memory Optimized`: Used for anything that needs memory-intensive applications, such as real-time big data analytics, or running Hadoop or Spark.
* `Accelerated Computing`: Include additional hardware (GPUs, FPGAs) to provide massive amounts of parallel processing for tasks such as graphics processing.
* `Storage Optimized`: Ideal for tasks that require huge amounts of storage, specifically with sequential read-writes, such as log processing.

<summary>  Diff. between fault tolerance and Disaster recovery ?.</code></summary><br><b>

Fault tolerant design ensures that system is up and working even in faulty scenarios. When you app / business can afford some time otherwise High Availablity will be required if don’t want any downtime.

Disaster recovery ensures that in situation when there is damage beyond repair, system is able to preserve key data and bring up servers in same state. Disaster can be failure of components or entire physical infrastructure.
